<p>In this class, <strong>benchmarks</strong> are what we call exams or quizzes. Each benchmark consists of 8 multiple-choice questions, and students have 10 minutes to complete them. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>One of the 8 questions</strong> is a question—or a version of a question—that a student got wrong in the past. This helps reinforce learning and provides an opportunity to correct misunderstandings. (more on this in <a href="office-hours.html#office-hours">Office Hours</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The remaining 7 questions</strong> are the ones you, our amazing uTAs, will craft with care and precision. These questions are designed to test different topics from the lecture and provide a learning opportunity for the students.</li>
<li>For each lecture, we create <strong>7 sets of questions</strong>, each targeting a unique topic from the material. Each set includes <strong>three versions of the same question</strong>, which we call <a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#mirrors-how-and-why">Mirrors</a>. Mirrors are essential for reducing the likelihood of cheating by providing different versions of the same question concept.</li>
<li>All benchmark questions are multiple-choice and require careful crafting of both the correct answer and the “distractors” (i.e., the wrong answers). A well-designed distractor is just as important as the correct answer, as it helps students critically evaluate their knowledge and apply concepts. Well thought out distractors will also reduce the number of students arguing for points back, which they <em>will</em> do! When a student contests a question/answer, we call these <a href="benchmark-queries.html#benchmark-queries">Queries</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why Do We Do Benchmarks This Way?</strong></p>
<p>Benchmarks are more than just a way to assess students; they are a <strong>learning tool</strong> designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage deeper understanding by focusing on scenario-based, real-world questions instead of rote memorization.</li>
<li>Encourage higher-order thinking by challenging students to apply and connect ideas.</li>
<li>Reinforce material by re-exposing students to concepts they struggled with in the past.</li>
<li>Reduce cheating by using mirrors.
<ul>
<li>By varying mirrors, we reduce the likelihood that students will just memorize questions they’ve gotten wrong, encouraging them to focus on understanding the concepts instead.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach reflects our belief that testing is an opportunity to <strong>learn through application and synthesis</strong>, not just a way to assign grades.
Alright… Let’s write some questions!</p>

<p>Example Question Set with Mirrors</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example question set about the “Who’s in the Expert’s Chair” segment from the “New Insights into Life and Learning” lecture. Take a look and while you do ask yourself what makes these good question? What are they all doing? How are they different?</p>

<p><strong>Source Details from Question Set Author</strong> <em>“Interventions for Belonging Uncertainty Growth Interventions Belonging Interventions Give two ideas: first these difficulties are normal, second they can improve “The process through which I become smarter is by speaking up in class” Reading and Writing Experiment… 7,600 freshmen randomly were assigned to a Growth Mindset or Belonging Intervention Belonging intervention… learn that most students are worried about belonging and then you learn about students that came to belong (joined orgs, asked questions, etc.) Growth mindset intervention… your brain can grow and develop; your abilities are not fixed… when you struggle, it’s not a sign that you’re dumb, you’re challenging yourself and building muscle Control group… standard orientation materials RESULTS: The achievement gap between high-socioeconomic and low-socioeconomic students and between races was REDUCED significantly after this (40%). From the Who’s in the Expert Chair segment at ~55:50 in the recording"</em></p>
<p>Let’s go over some of the key features of this question set.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Applying Knowledge/Real-World Application</strong>
<ul>
<li>Notice how each question is asking about a topic from the lecture in a way that encourages the student to <em>apply</em> the knowledge about <em>belonging uncertainty</em> to a new scenario, as opposed to just memorizing definitions. Each mirror ties the idea of <em>belonging uncertainty</em> to a real world situation. In this case the correct answer also reinforces researched based strategies the students are learning in class that they can even use themselves! This provides much <em>more of a learning opportunity</em> than, “Define belonging uncertainty.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Testing the Same Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each question (mirror) tests strategies for combating <em>belonging uncertainty</em> as discussed in the “Who’s in the Expert’s Chair” segment of the “New Insights into Life and Learning” lecture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Difficulty</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each mirror is of similar difficulty. It would not be fair to have a set with questions of varying difficulty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Variation in Stems and Contexts</strong>
<ul>
<li>While the concept remains the same, the stems are varied to frame the concept in different ways.
<ul>
<li>Mirror 1: A question about the best strategy in general.</li>
<li>Mirror 2: A scenario with an instructor, Mary, helping freshmen.</li>
<li>Mirror 3: A personal scenario involving an incoming student, Jimmy.</li>

4. Coordinate with your co-writers <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmIuDodgDF4-dwgu_SGt8LlgP6Axu1Ew/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112586054895113601386&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">Benchmark Writing Schedule</a> to avoid topic/question overlap.<br />
- One person writes 3 question sets (3Q), the other will write 4 question sets (4Q). (This will alternate.)
- You will be able to <a href="#recycling-questions">“recycle” old questions sets</a> for some of your sets, more on that later.
5. For each question set, write 1 benchmark question and 2 additional mirrors for each topic.<br />
6. Submit your completed sets to your editor by the date specified in the writing schedule.<br />
7. Revise your questions based on editor feedback.<br />
8. Submit your revised sets to the course coordinator for review by the date specified in the writing schedule.<br />
9. If needed, revise your questions based on course coordinator feedback then notify course coordinator when your questions are ready for review.
10. The course coordinator then uploaded the questions to Tower (the system we use to administer benchmarks).</p>

<div id="content-guidelines" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Content Guidelines<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#content-guidelines" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Choosing Topics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Given all the information the students have to take it, it would be unfair to write a question that is based entirely on one sentence in the lecture or readings. (This is not a memorization or detail test.) Try to focus on key concepts that are presented for ~5–15 minutes of lecture or multiple reading paragraphs. Try to think of the benchmark you are creating as a whole rather than focusing only on the questions you are writing. <strong>What are the most important things you think students should take away from the class (or that you personally took away from the class)?</strong> Does the benchmark assess those things? What is being left out? There is a lot of material in each lecture and readings, and we only have seven questions to test students’ understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus on Applying Concepts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use real-world scenarios to test concepts from the lecture that can be used to make predictions or gain understanding in real-world scenarios.</li>
<li>Just because a question includes a scenario does not necessarily mean it is an applied question. If the main thing you are asking students to do is match a scenario to a term/terms from the reading or lecture, you are probably asking a vocabulary question. Rather than testing recall of terms, questions should test if students can use critical thinking to understand the how/why/effects of concepts and how concepts connect to each other. You might try to <strong>think about how you can write question that challenge the student to use a concept from class to explain or predict a phenomenon in the real world</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Questions</strong>
<ul>
<li>When possible, concepts from earlier lectures/readings should be incorporated into new questions. This is a good opportunity to create distractors that are wrong in the context of the question without being as easy to eliminate. For example, one of the distractor for a question in the Adolescent Development benchmark refers to the hypothalamus from the Brain and Hormones lecture. The distractor is plausible in that the hypothalamus is indeed involved in the production hormones, however that is not the correct answer in this case.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Do Not Rely on Outside Information and Avoid Culturally Specific Examples</strong>

<div id="distractors" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Distractors<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#distractors" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Distractors are what we call incorrect answers. Writing good distractors is an art form. Most of what makes a question good or difficult is in the distractors because they force students to determine why the distractors are wrong. You should focus just as much time (if not more!) on writing good distractors as you would the correct answer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Distractors are Incorrect for a Reason</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure distractors are wrong for a specific reason based on what students have learned in class. More than making it hard for students to argue for the distractors, we want students to pick the correct answer because they see which possibilities are incorrect because of what they learned in this class. When you have a certain CA in mind it’s easy not to notice that some of the distractors could also be correct if you think about the question a different way.</li>
<li>Ask yourself,
<ul>
<li><strong>“Could someone argue this particular answer?”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Could someone interpret this distractor in such a way that it could be a plausible correct answer?”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Is there any possible way that distractor could be correct?”</strong><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remember, you will have to address any <a href="benchmark-queries.html#benchmark-queries">Queries</a> for a question you wrote!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exclusion Doesn’t Mean Wrong</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do not write distractors that are only “wrong” because they weren’t mentioned in class: this encourages students to ignore other potential factors in real life scenarios just because they happened not to learn about them here. And they could easily be true and you just don’t know! This is a recipe for queries…
<ul>
<li>One way around this is to ask <em>“According to X person/theory, what is the BEST…”</em> This way, you could theoretically write answer choices that just weren’t mentioned in class, as long as they can’t be argued to fit well with the theory/model in question. For example: “An adherent of Freud’s theory of the mind would MOST likely explain this by saying…”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“Not enough information…” - “None of the above” - “All of the above”</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do not use “It is difficult to determine…” or “There’s not enough information…” distractors. With the questions we write,it could certainly be the case there is not enough info. Life is complicated and even with the information we present in class, there may not be enough information to undisputedly “determine” anything in a hypothetical situation.</li>
<li>Avoid “None of the above” or “All of the above” answer choices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Always Avoid Extremes and Never Say Never</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoid extremes (always, never, all, none, etc.) in distractors (too easy to guess)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Answer Choices</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all your answer choices “look” the same. For example, if you write your answer choices with a period at the end, make sure all answer choices are in a similar format.</li>
<li>Distractors should be of similar lengths and depth. Don’t have some distractors be super wordy or one word answer amongst a bunch of one word or super wordy distractors, respectively.</li>

<h2>Mirrors: How and Why<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#mirrors-how-and-why" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Mirrors are <strong>different versions of the same question</strong>, designed to cover the same major topic (e.g., postsynaptic potentials). The primary purpose of mirrors is to <strong>prevent cheating</strong> by creating variations that make it difficult for students to collaborate or memorize answers. By following the following guidelines, you’ll craft mirrors that are effective, fair, and reinforce student learning while minimizing opportunities for academic dishonesty.</p>
<div id="key-guidelines-for-writing-mirrors" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Key Guidelines for Writing Mirrors<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#key-guidelines-for-writing-mirrors" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Ensure Consistent Difficulty Across Mirrors</strong>
<ul>
<li>All mirrors for a question should be of the same difficulty level to ensure fairness. We wouldn’t want one student to get the easy version and another to get the hard version.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Names in Question Sets Should Vary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Names should not be repeated within question stems or across mirrors. Be creative with the names you pick!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Avoid Identical Stems</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do not reuse the exact same question stem across mirrors unless:
<ul>
<li>You are <strong>changing all names in the stem</strong>, AND<br />
</li>
<li>You are writing <strong>completely new distractors</strong> (not just changing names in the distractors).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vary Correct Answers</strong>
<ul>
<li>If possible, consider using correct answers from one mirror as distractors in other mirrors. This adds variation and makes mirrors more effective at preventing cheating. (Students may see the same answer choices and incorrectly assume it is the same question as their co-conspirator.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a set for the <em>Psychology of Money and Social Class</em> lecture. Notice how the answer choices are essentially the same but all the names are changed and the correct answer varies based on the question stem.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the tag we use in Tower when we create a benchmark. We will set it up in such a way that it will pull one question from the “bm01_makeups” set. Each question set should have a unique Tower ID which includes “bm”, the benchmark number, and the topic. These <strong>must</strong> be the same for all mirrors. For example “bm01_makeups”.
<ul>
<li><code>bm01</code> = benchmark number 1</li>
<li><code>makeups</code> = the topic the questions are about</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question Topic</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Specify the key concept being tested. This is similar to the Tower ID but with a bit more detail.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stem</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is the question itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>D1-D4</strong>:
<ul>
<li>These are the four distractors. The order is <em>always</em> the same with the four distractors first and the correct answer last.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Correct Answer</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is the correct answer. This <em>always</em> comes after the four distractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>R/L/Int: from Reading, Lecture, or Integrative</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Your questions will come from information discussed in either the readings, lecture, or both. Use one letter to mark whether the question is based on:
<ul>
<li><code>R</code> = Reading<br />
</li>
<li><code>L</code> = Lecture<br />
</li>
<li><code>I</code> = Integrative</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Link to Material</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is is where you link to the readings or to the time in the lecture recording where a student could get more information about the question.
<ul>
<li>If you are linking to a reading, use the URL to the original content (e.g., NOBA link, <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-nature-nurture-question" class="uri">https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-nature-nurture-question</a>).</li>
<li>If you are linking to a moment in the lecture, use a time stamp but please be sure to format it as follows:
<ul>
<li>“Lecture hh:mm:ss” (You do not have to get down to the seconds.)</li>
<li>If you don’t write “Lecture,” sometimes Sheets tries to convert it to some weird date variable which messes things up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Source Details</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is quotes or information from lectures or readings that are most relevant to choosing the correct answer. This information is also very useful for editing and when responding to queries.
<ul>
<li>For reading-based questions: Copy a relevant excerpt that explains the correct answer.</li>
<li>For lecture-based questions: Include the time stamp and a brief synopsis or relevant transcript text.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author (current semester)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Update this field with your name, even if the question is recycled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New/Recycled</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If the question is new, write “New”.<br />
</li>
<li>If recycled, note the semester and year (e.g., “Fall 2019”) and describe any changes in the “Changes” column.</li>
<li>Always use the most recent version of a recycled question if it has been adapted in later semesters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Changes (if old)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When recycling a question, note what you changed/updated. For example, “Changed stem (scenarios, names) and tweaked answer choices”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="_images/benchmark%20spreadsheet%201.png" />
<img src="_images/benchmark%20spreadsheet%202.png" /></p>
<p>Lastly, at the very bottom of a spreadsheet, there are multiple tabs for each semester and year. You can use these old tabs to review and/or to recycle questions.</p>

<h2>Spelling and Formatting Formalities<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#spelling-and-formatting-formalities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>All the question writing and editing we do happens in Google Sheets, where we can freely use formatting tools like bold text, colors, and other visual aids to make the process easier. However, once the questions are finalized, the course coordinator will need to adapt that fun and visually enhanced sheet to match the strict format required for Tower. This step is critical, as Tower (the system we upload all of our questions to) has strict formatting rules that must be followed to ensure the questions work correctly in the system. Taking the time to double-check these details ensures a smooth upload process and prevents formatting errors from causing delays or issues. ;)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spell Check!</strong>: Please be sure to use spell check before you send your questions to your editors.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Math Symbols at the Start</strong>: Cells cannot begin with math symbols (<code>+</code>, <code>=</code>), as they are autoformatted into equations and may produce unintended results.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Numeric Ratios</strong>: Entire cells cannot be a numeric ratio (e.g., <code>50:50</code>), as they are automatically converted to times (e.g., <code>1:60</code> becomes <code>2:00:00.00</code>). This is also important when you write the time stamps for your “Link to Readings” section. If you input 15:25 (fifteen minutes and 25 seconds into lecture), this can be converted to an annoying date time. Use the following formatting for timestamps: <strong>Lecture 15:25</strong>. Typing “Lecture” in there is super important!</li>
<li><strong>Capitalize Key Words</strong>: Words like “According to the Lecture, which of the following is the <strong>BEST</strong> explanation for x,y,z?”</li>

<h2>Recycling Benchmark Questions<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#recycling-benchmark-questions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Based on your benchmark writing assignment for a given week, you’ll be creating 3 or 4 question sets. If you are assigned to write <strong>3 question sets</strong>, you can <strong>recycle 1 set</strong>. If you are assigned to write <strong>4 question sets</strong>, you can <strong>recycle 2 set</strong>. Recycling benchmark questions can save time and effort while still maintaining the quality of our assessments. However, it’s essential to follow specific guidelines to ensure the integrity and relevance of the questions. Below are the rules and best practices for recycling benchmark questions from previous semesters.</p>
</div>
<div id="guidelines-for-recycling-questions" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Guidelines for Recycling Questions<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#guidelines-for-recycling-questions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recycling Rules</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Every benchmark spreadsheet has multiple tabs at the bottom with questions from past semesters. You can refer to these for some potential sets. But <strong>do not recycle questions from the previous semester</strong>. Sometimes we have students from the prior semester retaking or completing the class in the current semester.</li>
<li>When recycling questions, <strong>always update the names</strong> used in the scenarios. Be extra careful about changing all instances of the name. If you change the gender in a scenario, be sure the <strong>pronouns are consistent across the stem and answer choices</strong>.</li>
<li>Modify some pieces of the <strong>stem or scenario</strong> and update distractors as needed. The goal is to avoid exact copies of old questions since these may already be available online.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Avoid Recycling Content That Might Change</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Fall semesters</strong>, the Thursday lecture are recorded live. To avoid recycling content that may change, it is better to wait for that recording before you start writing questions on segments that might have changed from the prior semester, like <em>Psychology in the News</em>. (So you are not writing too much over the weekend, it is a good idea to write some question sets on the readings, which you can send up the editing chain as they are ready. Once the recording is released, you can base your other sets on the lecture.)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Spring semesters</strong>, all the lectures are pre-recorded and available to you, so you don’t have to worry about timestamps or segments changing. (You could even get ahead with your benchmark writing in the Spring semesters!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consult the Source Details</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you’re recycling a question tied to a lecture or reading, double-check the <strong>Source Details</strong> column in the benchmark spreadsheet. Confirm that the referenced material is still accurate and up-to-date. Transcript information and time stamps can and do change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Make Note About Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lastly, on the benchmark spreadsheet for that lecture, please be sure to note in the “Changes (if old)” column, 1) the semester the question was pulled from, and 2) the changes you make to the question.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Editing and Revising Questions<a href="benchmark-writing-1.html#editing-and-revising-questions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For any benchmark, we have two writers and two editors. One writer creates 3 sets (2 new, 1 recycled) and the other 4 sets (2 new, 2 recycled). One editor is assigned for each writer and their corresponding sets. The editor reviews question sets for things like grammar, clarity, and consistency. Editors will have XX days to review questions and send feedback to writers. The writers will then revise and send to the course coordinator for review.</p>
